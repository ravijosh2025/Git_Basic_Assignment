Q5. How to un-stage changes from the staged area. write command for it.
Unstaging Changes from the Staged Area
If you have staged changes (added to the index) and want to move them back to the working directory, you can unstage them using the `git restore` or `git reset` commands.

Commands to Unstage Changes
1. Unstaging a Specific File**
- Command:
  git restore --staged <file-path>
  - This command removes the specified file from the staging area without changing the working directory.
- Example:
  git restore --staged src/app.js
2.Unstaging All Files
-Command:
  git restore --staged .
  - This command removes all staged changes from the index.
3.Using `git reset` to Unstage
-Command (Specific File):
  git reset <file-path>
  - This moves the file from the staging area back to the working directory.
-Example:
  git reset src/app.js
- Command (All Files):
  git reset
  - This unstages all changes but keeps the modifications in the working directory.
Note
- Unstaging does not discard the changes; it simply moves them from the staged area back to the working directory, so they are no longer included in the next commit.
